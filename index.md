### Welcome to Birds Are Real -- a Short Migration Through Northeastern University.

To get started:

1.  **Download** the _Hoverlay_ app from the Google Play store or Apple App Store.
2.  Make your way to **Cargill Hall** at 45 Forsyth St, Boston, MA 02115. **Stand on Huntington Avenue** facing southeast.
3.  Open the app and click the 'search' button. **Look for _solarWave_ and 'tune in' to that channel.**
4.  **Keep this page open** on your phone or tablet. Read each section.
5.  Look for birds. Point your phone at them. **Magic happens.**



## Birds are real!
From Huntington Avenue, face southeast. What do you see? What do you hear?

Welcome to a "bird's eye view" tour of campus. We'll be exploring the wonders of our avian relatives - acknowledging their existence - and appreciating some of Northeastern's beautiful artwork along the way.

The murals in front of you depict just a few of the world's 10,000 species of birds. How many can you recognize?

Point your phone at the artwork for more.

_When you are finished, turn left and walk up to the pavilion. Stop among the colorful sculptures._


## Nest
If you're a bird, you're **OVIPAROUS** -- that means you start out your life in a comfy little egg. Well, little if you're a hummingbird––only about 1/2 an inch long––but not if you're an ostrich. A single ostrich egg can weigh up to five pounds.

Tree swallows lay bright pink eggs.

Mourning doves are the speediest nest builders, putting together a complete crib in as little as two days. 

_When you feel like hatching, cross over the pavillion and make your way to Nightingale Hall._

## Let Your Beak Flag Fly
Birds have coexisted with humans for as long as we've been around, fascinating cultures around the world with their beauty and symbolism. At least nine countries sport eagles on their modern day flags, a symbol of strength, courage, and freedom. How many can you find in this mural?

_When you've thrown caution to the wind, make your way to Snell Library. Take the elevator to the third floor and turn around._

## Going Up
During the Covid-19 pandemic, we looked to the skies. Many people developed new hobbies and were able to enjoy the outdoors more often, and birding became a popular hobby. This elevator door artwork has data hidden within it. The bird silhouettes in the sky represent birding data as reported to citizen science database iNaturalist in 2019 (left door) and 2020 (right door). Each shape is scaled to the size of the number of observations for each group. Do you recognize any of the shapes of the most frequent(ly seen) flyers?

Crows, jays and ravens (a family called **corvids**), flycatchers, grosbeaks, sparrows, warblers, woodpeckers and wrens made it to the top of the list in 2020.

_Hey, enjoy the library while you're here. Maybe you'd like to read more about birds. We'll wait._

_Cool. You learned so much. Head back toward Forsyth street and stand between Ruggles Station and Ryder Hall._

## Paper Crane
Origami paper cranes, or _Orizuru_, represent the Japanese red-crowned crane, which are said to carry souls to paradise. 

Red crowned cranes eat everything and mate for life -- and the Japanese population is the only one that doesn't migrate. Sounds like they definitely found paradise.

_When you're ready, carry your soul behind you, across the quad to the exterior of the Behrakis Center (on the other side of Ryder Hall)._

## (Not So) Humble Beginnings

Birds are living dinosaurs. Which dinosaur in this mural do you think they're most closely descended from?

If you guessed the pterodactyl, you're in good company. That's what scientists used to think, too. Turns out that pterodactyls are closer to reptiles, while modern day birds evolved from a lineage of small theropods, a group whose larger members included the T. rex.

__That's all we've got for now. Go appreciate some geese. Then maybe you'd like to tweet about it?__
